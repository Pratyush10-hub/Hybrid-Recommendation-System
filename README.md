## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of a **Hybrid Recommendation System** that integrates:

- Matrix Factorization for collaborative filtering  
- Sentiment-aware Matrix Factorization  
- Confidence-weighted Fuzzy Inference System  
- Data-driven fuzzy rule generation  

The system predicts user–item ratings by combining numerical ratings with sentiment scores extracted from textual reviews. A Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system fuses both predictions using sentiment confidence, producing more robust recommendations.

This project is designed for **research and academic experimentation** and supports evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
